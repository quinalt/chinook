Background 

The Yukon river is a massive river that runs through Alaska and Canada, and contains sprawling expanses of pristine habitat. The river boasts one of 
the largest river deltas in the world, and contains endless miles of tributaries. This repository shows a quick analysis and exploration of the 
river's chinook salmon. It contains data from https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/17267, and primarily explores fish size versus 
tribuatary of origin. 

The repository is complimented by ARCgis maps as well as photos and text to guide the reader. 

The main file is the one that is Chinook_Yukon and not Chinook_Yukon(1). I am keeping 1 as some resumes redirect to (1)
